# WIRELESS NETWORKING I: INTEGRATION AND TROUBLESHOOTING

## Description

This course introduces students to 802.11 wireless networking. The course will
begin with an introduction to radio frequency (RF) fundamentals, components,
and signaling as it relates to 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLAN).
Students will get a brief history of wireless standards and understand the
different standards and organizations behind wireless networks in use today.
Wireless network topologies, architecture, and medium access control operations
are presented to help further understand how wireless networks are integrated
into other network types. Students will learn WLAN design concepts, deployment,
security, and troubleshooting. The remaining topics focus on site surveys and
next generation wireless networks. These concepts are further developed and
reinforced in the follow-on Wireless Networking II: Security and Analysis
course.
