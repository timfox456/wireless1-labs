# Section 4 RF Signal and Antenna Concepts

> Research on antennas is also a key part of creating a quality WLAN.
> The antennas can be used indoors and outdoors in point-to-multipoint
> and point-to-point installations. Part of antenna research is looking
> at the beam widths in the polar charts, horizontal and vertical to
> determine the best fit in a WLAN system.
>
> Visit the L-Com website or GNS Wireless and find the azimuth charts
> for each of the following antennas and be prepared to discuss.
>
> 24 dBi gain 2.4 GHz Parabolic Grid
>
> 30 dBi gain 2.4 GHz Parabolic Grid
>
> 15 dBi gain 2.4 GHz Yagi
>
> 32 dBi gain 5.4 GHz Solid Parabolic Dish
>
> What is the highest gain 2.4 GHz Omni Directional available through
> L-Com?
>
> Determining the Fresnel Zone is also important in WLAN design when
> considering point-to-point links. The Fresnel Zone has to be 40% or
> less block for successful communications.

Calculate the P-t-P Fresnel zone:

1.  Channel 11, at 6 miles

2.  Channel 40, at 4 kilometers

> Calculate minimum antenna height for the following installs. Use the
> formula to help you out: Radius (60%) = 43.3 x sqrt ( \[ D รท ( 4 x F )
> \] )

1.  Channel 1, at 8 miles

2.  Channel 52, at 10 miles
