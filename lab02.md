# Section 2 RF Fundamentals

Recall that wavelength is the measurement of distance that can be
calculated from the crest of one wave to the next or the length of one
complete cycle. Wavelength can be calculated using the speed of light
divided by the frequency. Remember that 1 GHz is 1,000,000,000.

Calculate or research the wavelengths in cm and inches to understand
antenna diversity:

 * Channel 6 (2.437 GHz) in 2.4GHz ISM band

 * Channel 11 (2.462 GHz)

 * Channel 36 (5.18 GHz) in UNII-1
 

What is the purpose of antenna diversity?

How can you use the wavelengths in antenna design and considerations?
